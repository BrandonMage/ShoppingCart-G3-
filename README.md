# ShoppingCart-G3-
A small team project for a simple shopping cart developed in java. 

This code shows a simple implementation of a shopping cart program. It allows the user to select from a list of products and add or remove them from a shopping cart. The user can view the items in the cart and proceed to checkout when they are finished shopping. The code is written in Java and uses HashMaps to store product information and shopping cart contents.

The main method initializes the products HashMap with product numbers and names, and then runs a loop that prompts the user for input until they choose to exit. Within the loop, the user is prompted to select a product and then choose an action to take on that product. The action options are "Add to cart", "Remove from cart", "View cart", and "Exit". The addToCart and removeFromCart methods are called to modify the contents of the cart, and the viewCart method is called to display the contents of the cart and prompt the user to continue shopping or proceed to checkout.

The getPrice method returns the price of a product based on its product number, and the formatPrice method formats a price value as a string with a currency symbol and two decimal places.
